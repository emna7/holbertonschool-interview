# Merge sort

For this project we are expected to write a function that sorts an array of integers
in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm

    Prototype: void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size);
    You must implement the top-down merge sort algorithm
        When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should
        always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}
        Sort the left array before the right array
    You are allowed to use printf
    You are allowed to use malloc and free only once (only one call)
    Output: see example

In the file 0-O, write the Big O notations of the time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case


## Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
